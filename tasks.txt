To-do(now):
---REFATOR CODE[In Progress]
---HOME[Done]
---DEFAULTS[In Progress]
- Make standard API for RNN(till VUE)
    - Make a comparison API that sends comparison data and accuracy(USE a slider for test data limiter) and maybe the image[Done]
        - [Sub-endpoint] Sends test data as an array[Done]
        - [Sub-endpoint] Sends prediction data as an array[Done]
    - Make a prediction only API that uses all the data as training data and predicts for 30 days after the data ends

- Make standard API for ARIMA[Waiting for model]
- Make standard API for LSTM[Waiting for model]

---CONFIGURABLE PAGE
- Make a test API for uploading any type of file in a directory from the server[Done]
- Make API for uploading Models of R5 extensions
- Make API for uploading your own datasets of csv format

---MODELS
    - Waiting for ARIMA
    - Waiting for LSTM
---

Problems
 - [Prediction only API(DEFAULTS PAGE - RNN)] We want to make predictions 30 days after the data ends, but we are using testing data of 30 days to make the prediction??
        - Tried to solve by removing the split and using all the data as train data(Did not work)
        - Tried to solve by following -- https://towardsdatascience.com/time-series-prediction-beyond-test-data-3f4625019fd9 (Can't understand)

To-do(at end):
---PPT
- Why we chose flask over django(Because we needed a lighweight server that we could test on very quickly. Django could have provided better security but we our focus was not security)

---Functionality
- Make so that users can upload their own datasets and models
- Make a paid version
- Deduct money for every successful run on the server


Notes:
- I should be able to host this thing on heroku even with the configurable option as i would not be using any database to store the data and would only be uploading the data to the server as a csv file
